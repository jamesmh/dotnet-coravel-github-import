# dotnet-coravel-github-import
Sample of a .NET application to import GitHub repos using Coravel

## Running It

Under `./Web/Startup.cs` in the `ConfigureServices` method change the GitHub user from my own to yours (or someone else if you want!).

Then, under _./Web_, run `dotnet ef database update` then `dotnet run`!
